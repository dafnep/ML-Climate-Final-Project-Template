Earth System Models (ESMs) and General Circulation Models (GCMs) represent the global climate system through mechanistic, mathematical equations. These models are used thoroughly in order to make future climate projections. However, disagreements among these simulations relative to observations and their predictions of climate change remain significant and incompletely understood, and no model has yet been proven capable of simulating the climate with a very high accuracy. These models have been used to make future temperature predictions, under specific assumptions relevant to the concentration of C02 in the atmosphere.   
On the other hand, Synthetic controls and matrix completion methods are often used to estimate causal effects in settings with panel data. Each matrix line represents a donor-unit and each column a specific timestamp. Some of the units are exposed to an intervention during some periods and the goal is estimating counterfactual outcomes for some unit-time combinations. For this project, we plan to  estimate global average temperature at a specific future time using the ESMs and GCMs as donors and assuming that the assumptions about the C02 concentration in the atmosphere represent actual interventions.
